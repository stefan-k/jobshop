# Documentation #

@stefan-k Let's write all documentation in [Markdown](http://warpedvisions.org/projects/markdown-cheat-sheet/)?


## Contents ##

* The files in the **open_jobshop** directory consider the Open Shop Scheduling Problem (OSSP) and use the evolib.

 
## TODO ##

### Big TODOs ###
* Test OSSP results against benchmark db -> Joris
* Is there a bug in hybrid genetic? Results are poor. -> Joris
* [OPTIONAL] Try using different algorithms
* Try different algorithm parameters
* [OPTIONAL] Are there other problems we can solve? E.g. normal jobshop, flow shop, the "CPU-problem", ...

### Small TODOs ###

* Maybe use alias Int/Uint instead of Int64?
* OSSP efficiency

* **DONE** dynamic stopping condition for selfish gene algorithm (now only max iterations)
